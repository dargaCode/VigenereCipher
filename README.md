# Vigenere Cipher
<strong>Language: C</strong>

Rotating repeatedly through a keyword string to encrypt text with a series of Caesar Ciphers.

When working on Caesar Cipher, I felt silly making so many small functions, but it made it much easier to go back and adapt the code to Vigenere.

I already knew intellectually that was supposed to happen, but it feels nice =D
